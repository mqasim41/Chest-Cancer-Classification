# Chest Cancer Classification

## Problem Statement: 
Early Detection of Chest Cancer using Deep Learning With MLflow experiment tracking and DVC.

### Challenge: 
Chest cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Traditional methods of diagnosis can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

### Proposed Solution: 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for the early detection of chest cancer using chest X-ray images.
